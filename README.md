# A Hybrid Framework for Generating Named Entity Descriptions Using the Given Context

This repository contains the code and resources for the paper titled "A Hybrid Framework for Generating Named Entity Descriptions Using the Given Context". The paper introduces a novel approach for generating descriptions of named entities, addressing the challenges posed by the evolving and ambiguous nature of these entities. The proposed hybrid framework combines conditional generation models with a classifier to improve the quality and alignment of the generated descriptions with the given context.

## Abstract
Generating named entity descriptions (GNED) is the task of describing a target entity. In this paper, a hybrid model for GNED based on conditional generation is presented. The framework incorporates two fine-tuned generative models based on the BART architecture, one of which masks the entity name in the given context. A BERT-based classifier is employed to select the best description generated by the two models, considering the given context. The hybrid model outperforms baseline models in all evaluation metrics. Additionally, an approach to handle inconsistencies between embedded language models (LM) knowledge and the provided context is proposed, which can be applied in various online systems.

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized as follows:

1. **make_datasets:** This directory contains the code for creating the necessary datasets for the generation and classification parts of the hybrid framework. For more information, visit this [link](https://github.com/saharsamr/NED/tree/master/make_datasets#readme).

2. **GNED:** The GNED directory contains the code for training, evaluating, and testing all three models: Context with the Plain Entity (CPE), Context with Masked Entity (CME), and the classifier. These models form the core components of the hybrid framework. For more information, visit this [link](https://github.com/saharsamr/NED/tree/master/GNED#readme).

3. **data_analysis:** The data_analysis directory includes the code for comparing the performance of the CPE and CME models on the worst results of the CPE, along with other analysis tasks. For more information visit this [link](https://github.com/saharsamr/NED/tree/master/data_analysis#readme).

Each directory mentioned above has its own README file with detailed instructions on how to use the code and resources provided.
